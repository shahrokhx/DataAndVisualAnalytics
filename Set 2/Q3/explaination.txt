When data values (y-dir) grow rapidly and the range of values is large, the linear scale may lead to ununiformed distribution of points and the points associated with the smaller values may be unintentionally ignored. In such cases, the log scale and square root are better choices. In practice, log scale is preferred for very rapid growth (e.g. exponential patterns) and squared root is usually applied for polynomial growth
