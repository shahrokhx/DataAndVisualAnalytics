D3 computes degrees in the “weight” attribute. So I create a linear scale to linearly scale the radius (rscale): Domain is between min and max degrees of nodes (max-min=9 so linear is fine, if this different is more, square-root might be better, See console_log). For the range I chose [4,15] by try and error in a way that the smallest one can be double-clicked and the largest one is reasonably large.
