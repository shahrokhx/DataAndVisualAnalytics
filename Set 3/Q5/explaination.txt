The results get worse (errors increased and R2 decreased) which indicates the important role of dealing with missing data (cleaning or replacing with mean, etc)

Two other regression models are tried: "Decision Forest" and "Neural Network". By these changes, different training models are obtained leading to different results and evaluation metrics, consequently. The results demonstrate: Decision Forest model provides better prediction (less errors and R2 closer to 1), while  NN provides the worst prediction among others.
