18: loading data file from input file (the first argument)

22: creating the data frame “table” by splitting the data file by Tab (“\t”)  and map the data to the defied Row class (line 11)

25, 26: creating  2 separate data frame (in and out) for outgoing and incoming edges.

31, 32: groupBy nodes and counting (it is not part of a solution, just for test)

35, 36: finding the average weights for each data frame out and in. the incomings are multiplied by (-1) to give the required value at the end.

39: joining two data frames and merging them to a new data frame called “all”

42: summation of required column (column 2 and 3) of data frame and obtaining the required gross average node weight.

45 and 52: writing the output with the required format (“\t”) in the output file (arg[1])
