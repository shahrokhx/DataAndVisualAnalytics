My Design Choice:

-	Using the Expansion layout to be more representative and the clusters can be more recognizable
-	Adjusting “Edge Weight Scale” to improve the noisy and messy appearance. 
-	Making the label of high degree nodes more readable due to their importance (They are popular/sociable in this network) + employing color ranking to recognize them
-	Using Size Ranking for node degrees to find the popular users and then arrange them in perimeter
-	Keeping the Root User (POLO) at center and in differnt color
-	Adjusting the size of nodes in the appearance tab to be consistence with the network size.
